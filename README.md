# EEG + EMG Personal Computer Use
An EEG + EMG Based personal computer use system with basic functionality.

## Software
The software package contains code for mapping the decoded neural activity to computer actions. This includes building tasks to collect neural data, saving neural data to the appropriate files alongside labels for training ML models, and real time mapping of neural activity into the computer screen. Also includes a GUI for real time recording of neural activity.

## Decoding
Machine learning algorithms for decoding EMG and EEG both discretely and jointly in offline analysis. Also contains code for processing the neural data and running real time decoding evaluation.

## Hardware
3D design files for our EMG wrist band alongside additional PCB designs. Folder for all the hardware related files for the EMG wrist band project
